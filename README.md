# Traversing Arrays

The Sunset Hills coding challenge is intended to assess a candidate’s ability to work with arrays. This challenge or a slight variation has been used by technology companies such as Amazon and was also featured on a Geeks for Geeks blog post titled “Amazon Interview Experience | Set 189 (For SDE-1)”.

## How It Works

This program has been modified to allow the user to enter their own values into an array before determining which "buildings" (positions in the array) can see the sunset.
